         <h1>10 Things To Do in Freeport, Illinois</h1>
         <p>Freeport, Illinois, also known as Pretzel City, is my hometown, and a beloved place I never get tired of. It's about a fourth of the size of Columbia, complete with a Starbucks, a new Marshall's, and a huge Walmart that people do end up hanging out at if they're bored enough. President Mun Choi told me he knows of Freeport because he drives near it when he's on his way to Galena, Illinois. So, if even Choi knows what Freeport is, why shouldn't you? I'll even give you some things to do while you're there â€” other than go to Walmart. </p>

          <p>Start your day with a latte and a slice of quiche at a cute downtown coffee shop. 9 East is pretty spacious, and there's even a game room that comes off the main area if you want more than just coffee with a side of morning chatter.</p>

          <p>Higher Grounds closed briefly because of the financial struggles the pandemic brought, but it's back in action and just as great to visit. Their smoothies are to die for, and you'll be glad if you can snag a seat next to the fireplace.</p>

        <p><a href="https://freeportparkdistrict.org/krape-park/">Visit Krape Park's website</a></p>
        <p>Krape Park is my favorite place to visit when I'm home. It's a sprawling park with long walking paths and a few different play areas (one with a real firetruck to play in). You can go by yourself to sit by the waterfall, take a jog through the pine trees, or catch a show at the outdoor band shell. Did I mention there's a concession stand there?</p>

        <p>If you want a great lunch at a nice value, get yourself a customizable sub sandwich at Garden Deli. Each sub is made right in front of you, warmed up, and served with carrots and pickles. It's family-owned, and they even sell ice cream, too. There's not many dining options in Freeport, but this is one of the all-time classics.</p>

            <h3>Classic Cinemas Movie Theater</h3>
            <address>
              115 S Chicago Ave.<br>

            <p>The theater also took a toll during the pandemic, but it's back in action, too. Set in downtown Freeport, the building itself is charmingly historic with a classic marquee to display the movies showing. They recently added theaters with reclining, heated seats. And you can get free refills on any size popcorn.</p>

        <h3>First United Methodist Church of Freeport Parking Lot</h3>
        <address>
          503 N Lily Creek Rd.<br>
          Freeport, IL<br>
          61032<br>

        <p><a href="https://www.umc.org/en/find-a-church/church/?id=48778">Visit First United Methodist Church of Freeport's website</a></p>
        <p>Strange as it might seem, this parking lot became a favorite spot during the pandemic. My two closest friends from home came here with me to sit outside of our cars, watch the sunset, and goof around until dark. Social distancing isn't as much of a thing now, but this lot is still a nice place to be when you need to be alone and look out over the west boundary of Freeport.</p>

      </a></address>
      <p><a href="https://theuniondairy.com/">Visit Union Dairy's website</a></p>
      <p>Union Dairy is and old-fashioned, '50s-styled ice cream parlor with more ice cream flavors than you can count. It's a perfect downtown pit stop on a hot summer day. And if you want more than ice cream, you can sit down for a hot dog or burger meal in one of their bright red booths.</p>

      <h3>Culver's</h3>

      </a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.culvers.com/restaurants/freeport">Visit the Culver's website</a></p>
      <p>Culver's is a popular place to go after a jazz band practice or a musical reharsal. It's staffed by lots of high schoolers, too, so you're bound to see a familiar face or two when you go in for a concrete mixer. It's somehow become one of Freeport's nighttime staples.</p>

          Freeport, IL<br>
          61032<br>

        <p>Applebee's is yet another nighttime staple in Freeport, especially when they still had their half-priced appetizers. It's a fun place to be on a Friday night, and the wait staff have a lot of personality to make the night interesting.</p>
