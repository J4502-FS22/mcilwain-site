            <img src="summer-images/internship.png" alt="A selfie taken on Columbia College's campus by Jaydin, who is smiling big in the middle. Katelynn is pictured to the left, and Sandra is pictured to the right, nestling her chin above Jaydin's shoulder.">
            <figcaption>Jaydin (middle), Sandra (right) and I (left) spent an evening walking around Columbia College campus sharing our faith. Talking to folks like this was the bulk of my internship with the church, and it was fun to push ourselves outside of our comfort zones, together..</figcaption>

            <img src="summer-images/beolwulf.png" alt="A shaved chocolate laboradoodle sits on the passenger seat floor in Katelynn's car. His eyes are closed against the sun, and his tongue is lolling out of his mouth.">
            <figcaption>My other money maker was dog sitting. Beolwulf, pictured here, was the third dog I watched over the summer, and he was by far the goofiest.</figcaption>

          <figure class="gallery-image">
            <img src="summer-images/hazel.png" alt="Katelynn, on the left, smiles at Hazel, on the right. Katelynn is wearing a sage green gown, while Hazel is wearing a beautiful white wedding gown. They are both holding bouquets. They are in Peace Park, on Mizzou's campus.">
            <figcaption>This summer, I (left) was in my first wedding ever as a bridesmaid. I got to support my friend Hazel (right), who’s been my friend and mentor for about four years now. It's a little tough graduating college without that conveniently timed relationship, but to celebrate hers was still a blast.</figcaption>

          <figure class="gallery-image">
            <img src="summer-images/aisle.png" alt="A small bouquet of baby's breath flowers is tied to a church pew that begins a line of several other similarly decorated pews down a church sanctuary aisle. Three women are standing and talking at the end of the aisle, by the altar. A large wooden cross is hanging behind them.">
            <figcaption>Little details like this one made the whole moment so beautiful. I’ve been on a journey of re-discovering intimacy with people, as my first introduction to it was traumatic. Marriage is probably the most beautiful and celebratory shades of intimacy I’ve been able to witness and be a part of!</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure class="gallery-image">
            <img src="summer-images/lake.png" alt="Sunset creeps over the lake, as tall, dark pine trees dot the blue, darkening sky. A little white circle, which is the moon, barely peeks out from one of the tree's branches. The trees and evening sky are reflected in the lake water below. The shore is made up of tan rocks.">
            <figcaption>Discovering beauty in nature away from productivity was another pursuit of mine this summer. Going to a friend’s family lake house with no plan besides enjoying whatever the day brought felt so liberating.

          <figure class="gallery-image">
            <img src="summer-images/paddleboard.png" alt="Jaydin, left, sits on a paddleboard with Katelynn, right. The pair are paddling together in a lake, with a young man paddling some yards behind them. They are both smiling and looking at the camera.">
            <figcaption>Jaydin (left) and I (right) went paddle boarding for the first time. I’m a type 6 on the enneagram, so trying new things isn’t really my cup of tea. But I was so elated to face my fear and leave the lake knowing that I could do it again, with no hesitation.</figcaption>

          <figure class="gallery-image">
            <img src="summer-images/pinnacles.png" alt="Carson, left, takes a selfie of Katelynn, middle, and Hayley, right. The trio are at a high point at The Pinaccles. Behind them are dozens of trees that they are elevated above, with a brown creek and sandy shore running in between them.">
            <figcaption>Another uncomfortable thing faced: hiking. Carson (left), Hayley (right) and I (middle) went to the Pinnacles; they showed me the ropes, and I left a sweating mess, but moments in nature like this make it all worth it. Carson said I handled the steep climbs like a champ.</figcaption>

          <figure class="gallery-image">
            <img src="summer-images/paintings.png" alt="Three canvas paintings sit side-by-side in a cark trunk. They are all different versions of light pink flowers against a white background.">
            <figcaption>This summer also saw my first voyage into the world of Facebook marketplace. This was one of my first purchases, a set of pink flower canvas paintings that I picked up in Ashland. I’ve never furnished a place other than a dorm room before, and the freedom to establish my space like this was daunting, but rewarding.</figcaption>

          <figure class="gallery-image">
            <img src="summer-images/keys.png" alt="A pair of keys are dangled in front of the first floor of an empty townhome. Sun is shining into the living roo area, which has white walls and gray wood flooring. Light brown wood cabinets that make up the kitchen are behind the living room area, separated by a counter.">
            <figcaption>The keys to my first off-campus place. I am still very intimidated by the world of adulting and living under a roof that I’m actually paying for. But entering into this new season with a refreshing summer of less productivity in my wake makes me eager to finish out school here at Mizzou and discover a new adulting adventure, hopefully with the lessons from this summer still inspiring my path.</figcaption>
